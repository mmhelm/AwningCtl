# AwningCtl
Custom hack for my broken awning's remote control.

## The Pain
When I press the up and down buttons on the remote control of my awning, the awning turns nuts and constantly moves up and down. The indicator on the remote control also shows that the remote is permanently sending some commands although no button is pressed. Only removing the batteries fixes the issue.

Nevertheless I've noticed that the awning is finally moving into the desired direction when I keep pressing the up or down button for a longer time (in general more than 5 seconds). Afterwards I have to remove the batteries otherwise the remote control would send random commands to all eternity.

## The Relief
As I don't want to buy a new remote control and I'm already tired of removing the batteries all the time I think a nice $\mu$-controller could also do the job, i.e. figuratively keep the button pressed for about 5 seconds and then remove the batteries.

Yes, I know ... it's like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut ... 

But it's fun! So here we go ...
